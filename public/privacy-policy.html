    <h1>Privacy Policy for Arcane Pi</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2025.06.20<br>
       <strong>Last Updated:</strong> 2025.06.25</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Arcane Pi</strong>, a fantasy RPG game built on the Pi Network ecosystem. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pi Network Public Profile Info:</strong> Your Pi username, Pi user ID (UID), and any permissions granted by the Pi Platform SDK.</li>
        <li><strong>Game Data:</strong> Character profile, progress, quest and combat history, inventory contents, leaderboard status, and preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Device/Session Info:</strong> Browser type, session duration, and general telemetry data for cheat detection and performance optimization.</li>
        <li><strong>Pi Transaction Logs:</strong> Purchase amount, in-game buy option, and the Pi Network transaction ID. We do not store your wallet address or private keys.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> Button clicks and combat logs to improve features and detect abuse.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect sensitive personal data such as email addresses, phone numbers, or financial account information.</p>
    <p>No additional personal information is collected for handling Pi transactions beyond the logs listed above.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>Your data is used to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enable and maintain your gameplay experience</li>
        <li>Store and sync your in-game progress</li>

        <li>Monitor for cheating or abuse</li>
        <li>Improve performance and stability of the game</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell or share your data with third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage & Security</h2>
    <p>We store your data on secure servers using MongoDB Atlas and other industry-standard practices. Data is protected using encryption, access control, and monitoring.</p>
    <p>Your Pi Network credentials are managed through Pi’s official SDK — we do not have access to your private keys or wallet.</p>
    <p>Transaction logs and analytics are stored for operational purposes and are routinely deleted after 12 months or upon verified request.</p>

    <h2>4. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
    <p>Arcane Pi does not set tracking cookies or store personal data in your browser's localStorage. The Pi Network SDK may set cookies or temporary storage strictly for authentication and payment processing.</p>
