    <p>Your access is provided via the Pi Network authentication system. You are responsible for keeping your credentials secure and notifying us of any unauthorized use.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access for any reason, including violation of these Terms or suspicious activity such as cheating, abuse, or exploitation of bugs.</p>

    <h2>3. In-Game Content</h2>

    <p>In-game items, currency, and progress do not carry real-world value and are non-transferable unless explicitly allowed through official Pi Network transaction mechanisms.</p>

    <h2>4. Payments and Pi Transactions</h2>
    <p>Arcane Pi may support purchases using Pi cryptocurrency on the Pi Network testnet or mainnet. Transactions are processed through the Pi Network SDK and we do not store your wallet information or private keys.</p>

    <p>Your use of the Pi Network is also governed by their separate terms and policies.</p>

    <h2>5. Pi Transactions and Revenue Use</h2>
